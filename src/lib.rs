//! Platform agnostic Rust driver for Sensirion SGPC3 gas sensor using
//! the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal) traits.
//!
//! ## Sensirion SGPC3
//!
//! Sensirion SGPC3 is a low-power accurate gas sensor for air quality application.
//! The sensor has different sampling rates to optimize power-consumption per application
//! bases as well as ability save and set the baseline for faster start-up accuracy.
//! The sensor uses I²C interface and measures TVOC (*Total Volatile Organic Compounds*)
//!
//! Datasheet: <https://www.sensirion.com/file/datasheet_sgpc3>
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! ### Instantiating
//!
//! Import this crate and an `embedded_hal` implementation, then instantiate
//! the device:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use linux_embedded_hal as hal;
//!
//! use hal::{Delay, I2cdev};
//! use sgpc3::Sgpc3;
//!
//! let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
//! let mut sgp = Sgpc3::new(dev, 0x58, Delay);
//!
//! ```
//!
//! ### Fetching Sensor Feature Set
//!
//! Sensor feature set is important to determine the device capabilities.
//! Most new sensors are at level 6 or above. Consult the datasheet for the implications.
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use hal::{Delay, I2cdev};
//! use sgpc3::Sgpc3;
//!
//!
//! let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
//! let mut sensor = Sgpc3::new(dev, 0x58, Delay);
//! let feature_set = sensor.get_feature_set().unwrap();
//! println!("Feature set {:?}", feature_set);
//! ```
//!
//! ### Doing Measurements
//!
//! Before you do any measurements, you need to initialize the sensor.
//!
//! ```ignore
//!
//! let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1").unwrap();
//! let mut sensor = Sgpc3::new(dev, 0x58, Delay);
//! sensor.init_preheat().unwrap();
//!
//! thread::sleep(Duration::new(16_u64, 0));
//!
//! loop {
//!     let tvoc = sensor.measure_tvoc().unwrap();
//!     println!("TVOC {}", tvoc);
//! }

//! ```
//!
//! SGPC3 has few things that you need to keep in mind. The first is pre-heating.
//! The amount of preheating depends on when the sensor was used the last time and
//! if you have the baseline saved. Baseline is adjusted inside the sensor with each measurement
//! and you want to save it eg. each hour in the case you need to reset the sensor and start
//! from the beginning.
//!
//! The recommended initialization flow is:
//! ```no_run,ignore
//! let dev = I2cdev::new("/dev/i2c-1");
//! let mut sensor = Sgpc3::new(dev, 0x58, Delay);
//! sensor.init_preheat();
//! sensor.set_baseline(baseline);
//!
//! thread::sleep(Duration::new(sleep_time, 0));
//! sensor.measure_tvoc();
//! ```
//!
//! The table provides pre-heating times per sensor down-time
//!
//! | Sensor down-time                     | Accelerated warm-up time |
//! |--------------------------------------|--------------------------|
//! |            1 min – 30 min            |             -            |
//! |             30 min – 6 h             |           16 s           |
//! |             6 h – 1 week             |           184 s          |
//! | more than 1 week / initial switch-on |           184 s          |
//!
//! Once the sensor has been taking the sufficient time for pre-heating. You need to call
//! measurement function eg. 'measure_tvoc'. This will enable the sensor to go to sleep and continue initialization.
//! The sensor readings won't change for the first 20s so you might as well discard all of them.
//!
//! You have two operation modes to choose from. Either the standard mode where you read the value
//! every 2s or use the ultra-low power mode where you read the sensor every 30s.
//!
//! If you want to use ultra-power mode, you want to call that prior calling any init-function.
//! Your baseline is power-mode dependent so you don't want to switch back and forth between
//! the power-modes as it always requires re-initialization. Also, the sensor accuracy varies between
//! the modes making the comparison of the values between modes no apples-to-apples anymore.
//! In another words, choose your power-mode per your application and stick with it.
//!
//! After initialization, you are ready to measure TVOC in loop per the selected measurement interval.
//! As said earlier, you want to stick with the internal - no shorter or longer than the defined value.
//!
//! If no stored baseline is available after initializing the baseline algorithm, the sensor has to run for
//! 12 hours until the baseline can be stored. This will ensure an optimal behavior for subsequent startups.
//! Reading out the baseline prior should be avoided unless a valid baseline is restored first. Once the
//! baseline is properly initialized or restored, the current baseline value should be stored approximately
//! once per hour. While the sensor is off, baseline values are valid for a maximum of seven days.
//!
//! SGPC3 is a great sensor and fun to use! I hope your sensor selection and this driver servers you well.
