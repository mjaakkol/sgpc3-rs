Platform agnostic Rust driver for Sensirion SGPC3 gas sensor using the [`embedded-hal`](https://github.com/japaric/embedded-hal) traits.

## Sensirion SGPC3

Sensirion SGPC is a low-power accurate gas sensor for air quality application. The sensor has different sampling rates to optimize power-consumption per application bases as well as ability save and set the baseline for faster start-up accuracy. The sensor uses IÂ²C interface and measures TVOC (*Total Volatile Organic Compounds*)

Datasheet: https://www.sensirion.com/file/datasheet_sgpc3

## Development status
The sensor is feature complete and the future development evolves:
- Moving into using Embedded-hal 1.x
- Fixed-crate 2.x migration
- Rust compiler 2021 changes

The package is 1.0.0 now. Major number is changed when non-backwards compatible changes are made.
The first minor number 1.x.0 is changed when new backwards compatible feature is added.
The second minor number 1.0.x is changed when fix without any feature changes have been made.

It is generally recommendated to set only the major number to get the future bug-fixes.
